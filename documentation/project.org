#+title:  Our Joint Project, Fall 2016


* You can find each other at [[file:./who.org][this listing of people and handles]].

* The file [[file:collective_report.org][collective_report.org]] is our formal record of our work, which we'll edit together.  This is part of the credit mechanism!

* Tasks for spam project, post to GitHub and discuss there as needed using the 

** specs, corpus, and preliminary code 
#+DEADLINE: <2016-11-29 Tue>

Discuss on GitHub as needed using the issue tracker (the "issues" tab on
the repo's home page).

Each person is to do his or her assigned TODO in an org file, just as we
have been doing for the homework.  So code goes in a python code block, comments
and specifications in an example block.  Name the file
your_lowercased_first_name.org.   Please note exceptions below.


   + identify the nltk method(s) and functions you will use.  Write the
     code out as far as you can and then test it on the sample email, after
     you understand exactly what you will get and need to produce (see
     below).  Modify your code accordingly. Post the code and its results
     of your code to GitHub.  REMEMBER, you're prototyping code, not doing
     everything at once.  Be sure to write your code as functions, so we
     can easily build the processing and analysis pipelines.

   + write out the specifications for the input and output formats for your
     step and post to GitHub!  Make sure they're exactly what NLTK says.

   + look at the specs for the steps before and after yours.  Discuss,
     using the GitHub issue tracker, if there are any differences
     between your specs and those of the others.  Resolve these.




*** DONE make private repo, munlp_f16 				       :toni:

The name of the repo is munlp_f16 and [[git@github.com:tonikazic/munlp_f16.git][here is its address]].


*** TODO post a sample email from the pre-processed corpus as a separate file entitled sample_email :meshal:



*** TODO post 10,000 randomly selected emails from each of the spam and ham parts of the PRE-PROCESSED ENRON corpus :meshal:

Under the repo subdirectory corpus, make a subdirectory for each portion and
put the emails as plain text files in their subdirectories.  Make sure you
preserve metadata and existing naming scheme.


*** TODO destringify the content of each email and write to each to a separate file in a form suitable for the next step :chris:

Preserve directory structure and file names, and place the results in the
repo directory destringified.
    
*** TODO segment each destringified email into sentences and save these in an appropriate format :james:

Preserve directory structure and file names, and place the results in the
repo directory segmented.


*** TODO lower case each destringified email and save appropriately :derek:

Preserve directory structure and file names, and place the results in the
repo directory lower_case.


*** TODO remove stop words and stem each email, and save output appropriately :pei:

Preserve directory structure and file names, and place the results in the
repo directory stemmed.
