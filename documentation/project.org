#+title:  Our Class Project


* People and Record-Keeping

   + You can find each other at [[file:./who.org][this listing of people and handles]].

   + The file [[file:collective_project_report.org][collective_project_report.org]] is the formal record of our
     work. We'll write this together, but you must ensure you sign your
     block with your tag in order to receive credit! 


* Tasks for spam project, post to GitHub and discuss there as needed

** specs, corpus, and preliminary code 
#+DEADLINE: <2016-11-29 Tue>

GitHub has a guide for the [[https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/][github workflow]], which we'll follow.



*** directories to use:  code and data

   + all code sketches go in the code subdirectory as an org file.  Put your
     code in python code blocks and the comments and specifications in an
     example block, just as we've been doing for the homework.  Name the
     file your_lowercased_first_name.org.  

   + all input and output go in the data subdirectory in the appropriate
     subdirectories, as noted below in your specific task.



*** branch to use: preliminary_code

Once you have everything, cd to the top of your local repo, [[github_jollies.org][switch to
branch preliminary_code]], and add and commit.


*** view others' work and discuss it with them

Discuss on GitHub as needed using the issue tracker (the "issues" tab on
the repo's home page).


*** overview of the project: [[./images/IMG_6188.JPG]]

*** what to do for your task

   + identify the nltk method(s) and functions you will use.  Write the
     code out as far as you can and then test it on the sample email, after
     you understand exactly what you will get and need to produce (see
     below).  Modify your code accordingly. Post the code and its results
     of your code to GitHub using the directories and branch specified
     above.  Be sure to write your code as functions, so we can easily
     build the processing and analysis pipelines.  REMEMBER, you're
     prototyping code, not doing everything at once.

   + write out the specifications for the input and output formats for your
     step in your org file!  Make sure they're exactly what NLTK says.

   + look at the specs for the steps before and after yours.  Discuss,
     using the GitHub issue tracker, if there are any differences
     between your specs and those of the others.  Resolve these.



*** the tasks

As you progress through your task, change its status (the colored word after
the stars) to one of:
   + STRTD  --- you've started the task
   + GNG    --- you've made some progress
   + DONE   --- the task is done!

Be sure to add and commit your version of this file to the repo!

**** DONE make private repo, munlp_f16 				       :toni:

The name of the repo is munlp_f16 and [[git@github.com:tonikazic/munlp_f16.git][here is its address]].


See [[file:github_jollies.org]] for how to get started with the github side of
things.



**** TODO post a sample email from the pre-processed corpus as a separate file :meshal:

Goes in [[file:../data/corpus/sample_email]].


**** TODO post 10,000 randomly selected emails from each of the spam and ham parts of the PRE-PROCESSED ENRON corpus :meshal:

Goes in [[file:data/corpus]].  Organize the emails so that nltk will recognize
them as a corpus.  Preserve metadata (e.g., is the email ham or spam?) and
the existing naming scheme. 


**** TODO destringify the content of each email 		      :chris:

Goes in [[file:data/destringified]].  Preserve organization of previous step.

    

**** TODO segment each destringified email into sentences and save these in an appropriate format :james:

Goes in [[file:data/segmented]].  Preserve organization of previous step.



**** TODO tokenize each sentence from each destringified email and save these in an appropriate format :kayla:

Goes in [[file:data/tokenized]].  Preserve organization of previous step.

**** TODO lower case each destringified email and save appropriately :derek:

Goes in [[file:data/lower_case]].  Preserve organization of previous step.



**** TODO remove stop words and stem each email, and save output appropriately :pei:

Goes in [[file:data/stemmed]].  Preserve organization of previous step.
