For each of the following tasks, do:

   + identify the nltk method(s) and functions you will use.  Test these on
     the sample email, after you understand exactly what you will get and
     need to produce.  Post the results of your code to GitHub.

   + write out the specifications for the input and output formats for your
     step and post to GitHub!  Make sure they're exactly what NLTK says.

   + look at the specs for the steps before and after yours.  Discuss,
     using the GitHub discussion forum, if there are any differences
     between your specs and those of the others.  Resolve these.
