* sorting through ideas and deciding on the class project <2016-11-15 Tue>

The conclusion is we will do spam analysis!

* tasks for spam project, finish by <2016-11-22 Tue>, and discuss on Github as needed


[[./images/IMG_6188.JPG]]


For each of the following tasks, do:

   + identify the nltk method(s) and functions you will use.  Test these on
     the sample email, after you understand exactly what you will get and
     need to produce.  Post the results of your code to GitHub.

   + write out the specifications for the input and output formats for your
     step and post to GitHub!  Make sure they're exactly what NLTK says.

   + look at the specs for the steps before and after yours.  Discuss,
     using the GitHub discussion forum, if there are any differences
     between your specs and those of the others.  Resolve these.


** DONE make private repo 					       :toni:

The name of the repo is munlp_f16 and [[git@github.com:tonikazic/munlp_f16.git][here is its address]].

** TODO post a sample email from the pre-processed corpus :meshal:

** TODO post 10,000 randomly selected emails from both the spam and ham parts of the PRE-PROCESSED ENRON corpus :meshal:

** TODO destringify the content of each email and write to each to a separate file in a form suitable for the next step :chris:

** TODO segment each destringified email into sentences and save these in an appropriate format :james:

** TODO lower case each destringified email and save appropriately :derek:

** TODO remove stop words and stem each email, and save output appropriately :pei:
