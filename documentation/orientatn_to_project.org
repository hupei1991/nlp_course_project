#+title: Getting Started on the Project
#+author: Toni Kazic

To get going, you need to:
   + [[file:mechanics/github_jollies.org][install github and clone our shared repository]]; and
   + read the [[file:project.org][project.org]] file in the documentation directory of the repo,
     and do your task as specified 


A copy of this file, github_jollies.org, and project.org are in both
class_notes and the shared repository in the documentation subdirectory.
