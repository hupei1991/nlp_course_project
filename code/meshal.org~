#+title: Sentence Segmentation

#+begin_src python

def sentenceSegmenter(email):
    from nltk import sent_tokenize
    import re
    
    space_removed = re.sub(r'\s+\.+', '.', email) # remove the spaces before the period
    money_spaces_removed = re.sub(r'(\$)(\s+)(\d+\.)(\s+)(\d+)', r'\1\3\5', space_removed) # remove the spaces involved with money
    
    sents = sent_tokenize(money_spaces_removed)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
sentenceSegmenter() takes in a single string of data that is an email. It used the re library
in order to clean up the string a bit so that it can interpret the end of a sentence properly.
The space_removed object is just a way to remove the extra spaces between the last word of a phrase
and a period. For example, "He went to school ." would become "He went to school.". There was also 
some strange spacing for money that needed to be cleaned up so that the decimal wasn't interpreted
as the end of a sentence. Once the string is cleaned up for these two issues, it is run through the
sent_tokenize method, which splits the the sting by sentences. This is the object that is returned.

* TEST

Below is a test of the sentenceSegmenter method defined above on the ham
email provided.

#+begin_src python :session :results output

# read in ham file for test 
with open("/data/corpus/sample_email_ham.txt") as f:
    raw = f.read()

# remove newline character
n = raw.split('\n')

# join the lists back together into a single string
s = ' '.join(n)

# segment the sentences
sentenceSegmenter(s)
